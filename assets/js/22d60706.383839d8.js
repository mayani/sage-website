These fish are then unable to escape making them easy picking for fishermen. This method was used by the indigenous peoples of Hawai'i to sustainably feed the island. Each rock surrounding the pond was taken and placed intentionally by hand. At first glance it may seem that they made the walls too short since the ocean water spills over into the pond, but in actuality the ocean has risen due to climate change over the years.

Computer vision and remote sensors could replace a lot of the work needed to monitor the water conditions in each tank. Currently somebody has to go out and measure the water conditions, and automating that process would make the work much easier.
