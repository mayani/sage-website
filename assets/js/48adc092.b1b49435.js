Notably, the self-supervised model even showed potential for semantic segmentation without the need for labeled data which we would like to explore further. The results were comparable to the other studies of our team lead by Bobby Jackson, an atmospheric scientist and instrument specialist at Argonne, who primarily utilized Doppler Lidar data.
