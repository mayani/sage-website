Further, specific technical hurdles with tools like Docker or Rancher Desktop prevent Mac or Windows users from even integrating certain sensors with their own machine for development and testing.\\n\\nIn response to this challenge, the team has dedicated a focused effort on building out a comprehensive testbed.  This testbed, funded by the [NSF Sage project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1935984), consists of 16 Wild Sage Nodes and 14 Sage Blades which all have access to a range of sensors such as PTZ and thermal cameras, with the explicit intent of being made widely available to the community for development access.\\n\\nThe Northwestern University Sage Testebed is hosted at a testing site on the Argonne National Laboratory campus.

This was a truly unique experience and taught me the value of collaboration among scientists and communities to reach goals.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Background Context & Preparation\\n\\nOn 10/26, the team met at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa with scientists [Thomas Giambelluca](https://geography.manoa.hawaii.edu/thomas-giambelluca/), [Han Tseng](https://www.wrrc.hawaii.edu/person/han-tseng/), and [Dylan Giardina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-giardina-747a56188/). We were all excited to begin preparation and unpacked the shipments for deployment. The interns helped with transporting materials and installing stainless steel equipment into the node; Raj worked with Han to explain the input-ouputs and wiring for installment; and the rest of us helped pack other equipment and ropes for an efficient deployment experience on the tower. With all hands on deck, we finished the deployment procedures swiftly and ended the day with some delicious food from a local Hawaiian eatery!\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnaghaTiwari/anaghatiwari/gh-pages/sage/IMG_5176.jpeg)\\n*Setup and preparation for deployment at the University of Hawaii @ Manoa*\\n\\n## D-Day: The Deployment\\nAt 7:00 AM in the morning, the team drove to Volcanoes National Park with the hiking equipment and sensor parts in hand, ready to mount the 80-foot tower! [Jason Leigh](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/cinema/staff-member/jason-leigh/) and [Ryan Theriot](https://www.ryanctheriot.com/) flew down from the [Lava Lab](https://www.lavaflow.info/) to the site to assist with the installation procedure. With over 11 people on-site, we all got our hard-hats on, geared up with equipment, and got the exciting momentum running for the mission ahead of us!\\n\\nThe video footage below exhibits some of the challenges we faced, and how teamwork was absolutely essential for installation on quite a tall tower with dense canopy, fragile equipment, and limited time. The interns were handling the ropes; Raj was directing the installation; Han, Dylan, and Tom were the tower climbers; Jason, Ryan, and I were recording video footage of the experience; and Pete was overseeing the climbers at the top. Every individual, every effort, every responsibility was integral to the deployment experience, and after 10 hours of dedication, we successfully installed the Wild Sage node and were even able to see live audio and image feedback!\\n\\nThe node is installed at approximately 80 feet high and includes equipment such as Lorowan, a rain gauge, gps, and high-accuracy cameras for audio, imaging, and sensor capabilities. Edge apps on these sensors will collect data and analytics on air quality, pollution levels, cloud cover, diversity monitors, solar irradiance levels, and more. We hope to provide this data to local Hawaiian communities and to the national parks to assess the impact of wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and diversity in plant and animal species in the surrounding area.\\n\\n<iframe title=\\"Sage: AI @ Edge\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mH26pUrn74\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" id=\\"fitvid61143\\"></iframe>\\n<figcaption>\\n    <em>\\n        The thick canopy and tower height presented challenges in hauling the node to the top - teamwork, patience, and clear communication made it possible!\\n    </em>\\n</figcaption>\\n\\n\\n## Relationships and Collaborations for Current and Future\\nI believe that the foundations for such a monumental and successful deployment are the relationships and collaborations Sage developed and nurtured with individuals and organizations in Hawaii.\\n\\nSuch collaborations, especially when interdisciplinary and geographically diverse, can be multifaceted and often complex. Relationships between scientists, their scientific domain, and their research can be varied yet unique. The field trip to Hawaii represents key interactions and collaborations between scientists, where diverse scientific domains such as edge computing, computer science, and the climate sciences can be integrated to pursue groundbreaking research goals.\\n\\nThe foundational relationships between universities, scientists, and the Sage team in Hawaii are key for future relationships and deployments that encourage the pursuit of science and research. For instance, Han, Tom, and Dylan were all key scientists to the installation success because of their contagious passion for science and research, their willingness to support the Hawaiian communities through providing accessible environmental data, and their hard work during deployment.\\n\\nSage sensors and edge computing act as vital segways where data collection benefits climate scientists and provides a unique insight into the Hawaiian culture and environment. Through the beauty of teamwork and collaboration, science can be transformed into a catalyst for transformational feedback and change.\\n\\n\\n![](https://github.com/AnaghaTiwari/anaghatiwari/blob/gh-pages/sage/IMG_6575.JPEG?raw=true)\\n*Mission Success!

My research involves wireless sensors and integrating the Sage infrastructure with low-cost nodes.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThere aren\'t many employers that fly out their interns to tropical islands. But that\'s why Argonne National Lab is so incredible! This last week, I learned what it means to be a computer scientist that helps people. My biggest dilemma with applying to graduate school has been figuring out how I\'d positively impact people\'s lives with my research. Argonne allowed me to see exactly that on this trip. I saw how lab work leads to applicable instrumentation, which allows different scientists to answer their research questions to help people. And it was incredible to see people so passionate about their work.\\n![working on node in jungle](./img/hawaii-october-2023/jungle.png)\\n\\nMeeting Derek Esibill and his son Kai in O\'ahu taught me that science is beautiful. It was clear from the beginning they both care deeply about Hawaiian culture and its people. Derek\'s research aims to restore the traditional ways of aquaculture to support the growing needs of Hawaii. He uses sensors to track the flow of fish and to study the composition of the pond water. We visited the pond to explore how Sage can introduce wireless sensors to facilitate the process of data gathering. I saw how my research on wireless sensors could help other scientists to answer questions relating to food sustainability. To me, that means a lot because it revealed to me how remote lab research translates directly to helping people across the world. And in return, hopefully, restore the tradition of cultivating food in Hawaii.\\n![fishpond in O\'ahu](./img/hawaii-october-2023/pond.png)\\n\\nAnother insightful moment was when we went up to the water tower in Lahaina. As a computer scientist, you don\'t learn about the social aspect of using your research for the betterment of society, so before the trip, I saw computer science research unrelated to social impact. The Sage project is special because apart from the interdisciplinary work to answer climate and ecological questions, the scientists on the team also care about the people they work to help. For example, it\'s important to make scientific data and discovery more digestible for the people in Lahaina to provide insight to their questions, and computer science visualization techniques do exactly that. It\'s also important to be sensible to community needs with the research questions to ask and prioritize. Again, I saw how my research could help on-the-field scientists surveil the land and skies with greater efficiency, allowing for quicker answers to pending questions.\\n![sliding sands hike crater](./img/hawaii-october-2023/crater.png)\\n\\n\\nI\'m forever thankful for this opportunity to not only hike above the clouds and swim in the Pacific Ocean but to meet scientists and understand their motivation behind discovery. Their insights helped me understand that computer science can directly help people through collaboration with other scientists and providing better data collection. I know now that lab work doesn\'t have to stay just in the lab but can be used in real-life situations to help people, as long as there\'s an understanding between the scientists and communities. Thank you again to all the team members from Illinois and Hawaii for sharing their experiences."},{"id":"/2023/10/30/alex-blog-hawaii","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2023/10/30/alex-blog-hawaii","editUrl":"https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sage-website/edit/main/news/2023-10-30-alex-blog-hawaii.md","source":"@site/news/2023-10-30-alex-blog-hawaii.md","title":"The Waikalua Loko Fish Pond","description":"team photo","date":"2023-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Hawaii","permalink":"/news/tags/hawaii"},{"inline":true,"label":"Node deployment","permalink":"/news/tags/node-deployment"},{"inline":true,"label":"Fish ponds","permalink":"/news/tags/fish-ponds"}],"readingTime":3.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Arnold","title":"Undergraduate student, Northwestern University","socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-arnold-6b168a1a7/"},"imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114937598?s=400&u=3cc10cf57e285dd0d8b32dae2646dc6ae71ff14b&v=4","key":"aarnold","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"The Waikalua Loko Fish Pond","authors":"aarnold","tags":["Hawaii","Node deployment","Fish ponds"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Serving the Hawaiian Community with Sage Nodes","permalink":"/news/2023/10/31/Hawaiian-Community"},"nextItem":{"title":"Joann Hawaii Blog Post","permalink":"/news/2023/10/30/joann-blog-hawaii"}},"content":"![team photo](./img/hawaii-october-2023/Group.jpg)\\r\\nHi there! My name is Alex Arnold and I\'m currently a senior at Northwestern University studying computer and cogntitive science. I worked with the team over the summer as an intern and also had the chance to help with a node deployment in Volcanos National Park in Hawai\'i.\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\nToday we arrived in Honolulu. We checked into our hotel right off of the famous Waikiki beach, where we saw a lot of surfers catching waves out in the water. After a nine hour flight we were incredibly hungry so Aldo and I picked up a local snack: musubi spam. It\u2019s basically spam on top of rice and wrapped together with seaweed. Served hot, it was unexpectedly good and a pleasant surprise. After a long flight without much food it tasted incredible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter taking a short break, we headed out to the restored indigenous fish pond Waikalua Loko, which is run by the Pacific American Foundation (PAF). We crossed through a tunnel under the mountains that divide Oahu to get to the northern side of the island. We saw beautifulk views as the sun set over the mountains. We then met Dr. Derek Esibill from Windward Community College. He is working on restoring a pond that can be used to sustainably harvest fish from the bay. His work is also through a cultural lens and makes sure to incorporate education about Hawaiian culture and practices.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Fish pond](./img/hawaii-october-2023/fire.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pond is full of brackish water due to the combination of water coming in from the ocean and from a stream coming down the mountains. The two combine to make a hospitable environment for the fish to come in as youths through gates with wooden slats and fatten up. These fish are then unable to escape making them easy picking for fishermen. This method was used by the indigenous peoples of Hawai\'i to sustainably feed the island. Each rock surrounding the pond was taken and placed intentionally by hand. At first glance it may seem that they made the walls too short since the ocean water spills over into the pond, but in actuality the ocean has risen due to climate change over the years. While most of the rocks are originally, these walls have been reinforced to combat the rising sea levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere used to be hundreds of these ponds, but most of them were filled in and now host fish inside of a Costco instead of the water. This particular pond also isn\u2019t quite ready yet. A sewage treatment plant used to dump human waste into the water (remnants of which only disappeared less than two years ago) and now invasive mangrove trees have disrupted the sediments. Luckily, is working on restoring the pond and in the meantime he\u2019s growing fish in tanks to \u201cseed\u201d other ponds in the area.\\r\\n![Pond node](./img/hawaii-october-2023/node.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\u2019s currently a Sage node (W071) set up right above the fish tanks that we saw in action. It\u2019s monitoring the air quality levels and environmental data right now, but there\u2019s a lot more the team is wanting to do with it. Computer vision and remote sensors could replace a lot of the work needed to monitor the water conditions in each tank. Currently somebody has to go out and measure the water conditions, and automating that process would make the work much easier. A node could also be used to monitor the water level and flow of the pond with nothing but an image, and more work needs to be done to create robust models that can predict that better than the current sensors can.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we left the fish pond we all went out to dinner and learned about what other foods we should try. Derek\u2019s son Kai (our honorary guide and recommended Poi and Lau Lau) and tried to stay up to combat jet lag. By the time we got back to our hotel we were all exhausted, but we made one more trip to the beach to take in the ocean to relax before turning in for he night."},{"id":"/2023/10/30/joann-blog-hawaii","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2023/10/30/joann-blog-hawaii","editUrl":"https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sage-website/edit/main/news/2023-10-30-joann-blog-hawaii.md","source":"@site/news/2023-10-30-joann-blog-hawaii.md","title":"Joann Hawaii Blog Post","description":"My name is Joann Lenart and I am a current senior at Northwestern University.

It seems out of my wheel-house but it was also an eye-opening experience to see how we can bridge the social sciences with computer science.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWhile in Hawaii, I observed some societal patterns and themes that were interesting to me. One of the first examples was at the airport. Directions and announcements were first stated in Native Hawaiian, then in English. Having done research with Indigenous groups in the past, this small detail has a broader impact regarding their status in the state.\\n\\nAdditionally, the environmental laws passed in Hawaii are noticeable and prevalent in a positive way. To enter national parks, shoes need to be scrubbed to prevent invasives. Plastic bags are banned and the single-use cups and utensils are all eco friendly. Certain chemicals are banned from sunscreens. These laws work here but they are not seen on the mainland. It appears the key for these environmental laws to pass and function is the need from citizens to also want to help the environment. Helping the environment is a collective effort and there must be motivation from both parties to combat the effects of climate change.\\n\\nOn Day 6 of the trip, the research team went to a water treatment plant to survey the area since a new Sage Node will eventually be installed there on a weather tower. The tower overlooked the town of Lahaina which unfortunately was devastated by the wildfires earlier in August. This node will be used to detect smoke and track temperatures to see which area is most vulnerable to wildfires to try to prevent another disaster from occurring. The community members are still recovering and are still terrified months after this devastation. Once the sage node is up, the team will work with the local community by creating a dashboard with accessible information such as if the air quality is healthy. Additionally, after discussing with Chris, a hydrologist, about this data, there is potential to give this data to the government and council in charge to decide what policies to pass and to use this data in court cases to pass climate legislation and advance environmental justice. It is about being transparent and having the local community involved.\\n\\nDespite not being a computer scientist, there are many areas where the social sciences can be bridged with the computer sciences. It is about how you use the data collected with the community groups most impacted. On paper I may have been an outlier with my background, but during discussions with many other scientists and researchers, it did not feel as if there was a gap between our research. Many computer scientists want to bring in social sciences to their work and be more than just programmers.

Green box represents that the pedestrian has taken the crosswalk while crossing the street. White box represents that the pedestrian has not crossed the street yet.\\nMotivation\\n\\nAn accurate and clear information about pedestrian travel patterns is a critical component of transportation planning, management and safety. Sound data on pedestrian system usage is needed for traffic safety, operations, maintenance as well as system user outreach and education.  According to CDC report <sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>, in 2017 alone, 5977 pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes in the United States. That\u2019s about one death every 88 minutes. The broad motivation of this study is to explore the pedestrian travel patterns to understand the contexts in which they violate the traffic rules. To do so, the immediate goal is to count the number of pedestrians who do not follow the crosswalk while crossing the street.\\n\\n## Data Description\\n\\nIn this study, a total of 2,580,468 images were collected by employing a vision camera embedded in an AoT (Array of Things) <sup>[[2]](#references)</sup> node (shown in Fig. 2). The AoT node is installed on a streetlight pole at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL in front of the Computer Science building. The camera captures the image (as shown in Figure 2) at 1 Hz frequency with the resolution of 96 dpi.\\n\\n![aot install](./img/ped-count-for-cross/Figure-2.jpg)\\n\\n> Figure 2: AoT node installed on a light pole at NIU campus\\nApproach\\n\\nIn this section, I present a brief overview of the pedestrians counting process for crosswalk violation. The complete process is divided into 3 sequential sections as shown in Figure 3. First \u2013 detect every pedestrian in the image, second \u2013 re-identify same pedestrian in successive images to avoid their recounting and third \u2013 detect when the pedestrian finished crossing the street. Each part is explained in the following sections.\\n\\n![workflow diagram ](./img/ped-count-for-cross/Figure-3.png)\\n\\n> Figure 3: Workflow diagram for pedestrian crosswalk violation\\nPedestrian Detection\\n\\nThe first step is to detect every pedestrian along with their position in the image. To do so, one approach could be to train a neural network-based pedestrian detection model that identifies and locates the pedestrian in the image. However, this process would require a lot of manual image tagging without getting any new results since several popular pre-trained models are already available that can do a fine job in person detection. These pre-trained models are trained on a popular COCO dataset <sup>[[3]](#references)</sup> which includes more than hundred thousand images. Model accuracy is an important factor here because if it misses any pedestrian in the image then the final pedestrian counting cannot be accurate. To take it into consideration, I selected the Faster R-CNN <sup>[[4]](#references)</sup> based NasNet <sup>[[5]](#references)</sup> object detection model from the TensorFlow model zoo <sup>[[9]](#references)</sup>. Although NasNet model has high latency, it has very good mean average precision value to detect the objects precisely in the image. The images are input to NasNet model and store the prediction results in the XML format. A sample of image and generated XML is shown in Figure 4. XML stores each detected objects\u2019 name and their box coordinates.\\n\\n\\n![output image and xml from NasNet](./img/ped-count-for-cross/Figure-4.png)\\n\\n> Figure 4: Output image and XML generated from NasNet object detection model. Detected objects are boxed in the image.\\nPedestrian Re-identification (ReID)\\n\\nOnce each pedestrian\u2019s position is stored in the XML, the next part is to identify them in successive images to avoid their recounting. In computer vision community, this task is called pedestrian re-identification (ReID) [7]. The idea behind ReID is to find a metrics or representation of a pedestrian in the image that is invariant of different angles, distance, zoom level, etc. Neural networks-based models try to learn local regions (shoes, glasses, hair color, etc.) as well as global full body region (t-shirt and shorts color, design, etc.) features to discriminate the one pedestrian from others. At the end of training, these models aim to generate invariant multi-dimensional features of a pedestrian from different angles, distance, clothes, etc. In this study, I have leveraged a deep learning-based model deep-person-reid [7,8] to generate such features of each pedestrian detected in the frame to compare with the pedestrians from the following frames for re-identification. The model generates 1024-dimensional features for each pedestrian cropped in a rectangular box. The cosine similarity is calculated for feature vectors of one frame against successive frames. Pedestrians are considered same if they have high cosine score, hence, assigned the same pedestrian id. In other cases where cosine similarity is below a pre-defined threshold, both pedestrians are assigned different ids. Low matching score may also happen where pedestrian is partially occluded by a car or another pedestrian in next frame, the similarity score gets very low. To mitigate this issue, the algorithm compared the current frame against last 5 consecutive frames to avoid assigning new id to same pedestrian. Another challenge I faced with the threshold-based matching is when one pedestrian had high similarity scores against multiple pedestrians. To fix this issue, I employed the greedy method in which it ranks each pair according to their similarity score. Based on their ranking, the algorithm picks the top pair and assigns same id to both pedestrians, and subsequently removes other pairs where any one of the pedestrians from the top pair is present. By employing these techniques, I was able to assign unique id to distinct pedestrian.\\n\\n## Pedestrian Count for Crosswalk Violation\\n\\nNow that a unique id is assigned to each distinct pedestrian (barring any errors), the next and the final step in the pipeline is to count the number of pedestrians who have violated the crosswalk while crossing the street. The output of this step will be two metrics for any given time period \u2013 1) number of pedestrians crossed the street and 2) number of pedestrians followed the crosswalk while crossing the street. Subtracting the 2nd metric from 1st one will give the count of crosswalk violations. To compute these metrices, it is important to locate the street and crosswalk in the image. Fortunately, in this case, camera is installed on a fixed streetlight pole which didn\u2019t shake or vibrate significantly due to wind or heavy vehicles. Taking advantage of it, I pre-set the location of crosswalk and street in the image (as shown in Figure 1, the crosswalk is highlighted in yellow and both sides of street in red). While the pre-set of crosswalk is represented in a form of convex polygon, both sides of the street are depicted by two parallel straight lines. These representations helped to determine the location of any pedestrian with respect to the crosswalk and the street. To recall, pedestrian\u2019s location in the image is stored as co-ordinates of 4 corners of a rectangular box. In a 2D image, it is essential to measure each pedestrian\u2019s location by a single (x,y) co-ordinate to make a concrete decision about their position with reference to crosswalk and street. If we observe the Figure 5, the lady is walking on the pavement towards the computer science building, but her head and center of body are still in the street (due to 2D image display) while legs are on the pavement. Similar observations in multiple images made me select the legs position to represent the pedestrian\u2019s location because when pedestrian moves, legs represent the current location in the 2D image.\\n\\n![an detection of crossing](./img/ped-count-for-cross/Figure-5.jpg)\\n\\n> Figure 5 : Our algorithm detects that a person has crossed the street.\\n\\nNow that a pedestrian\u2019s position has been established, I will briefly discuss about the simple rules to determine if a pedestrian has crossed the street and followed/ violated the crosswalk.  A pedestrian is considered to have crossed the street if they are detected on both sides of the street within a fixed time. To recall, the street has been represented by two straight lines, one for each side (as shown in red in Figure 1). The sign of these straight lines against the pedestrian\u2019s coordinates exhibits their position relative to the street. For example, as we see in Figure 6, points A and B are in opposite sides of the straight line which can be verified by putting the value of these points coordinates in the line equation. While the value for point A is -2, for point B it is +3. Opposite signs of both points resemble that they are in opposite sides of the straight line. By similar means, we can compute if the pedestrian has been present to both sides of the street which will confirm that the pedestrian has crossed it. Additionally, to determine if the pedestrian has used the crosswalk, we can similarly verify their positions in the middle of the street. If all of their detected positions are inside the crosswalk polygon, I consider that the pedestrian has used the crosswalk. Using these 2 metrics, the count for crosswalk violations can be easily computed.\\n\\n![determining position](./img/ped-count-for-cross/Figure-6.png)\\n\\n> Figure 6: Determining the position of the points with respect to the straight line\\nFuture Works\\n\\nIn the current study, the implemented system is able to count the pedestrians who violates the crosswalk. Currently, data processing and AI algorithms execute on a server located in computer science building where AoT node periodically stores the images. Many images are lost due to wireless nature of communication. One potential solution can be to implement the algorithms on the AoT node and only transmit the results (instead of images) to server to reduce the overhead on wireless connection significantly. Further, I would like to generalize the system for other sites as well. For that, algorithms have to identify the street and crosswalk automatically in the image.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n1.

The curriculums are developed and taught by Argonne Educational Programs staff and Argonne scientists. The Big Data Camp curriculum targets juniors and seniors who have programming experience.\\n\\n\u201cWe teach students how researchers produce and process data to better understand a whole range of complex problems from the urgent, like those posed by the current pandemic, to the theoretical, such as the nature of dark matter,\u201d said Michael E. Papka, Argonne senior scientist and camp instructor, who also helped establish the Big Data Camp three years ago. \u201cWe build on their existing programming knowledge and introduced them to some of the same techniques researchers use at the lab to interrogate data and gain new insights.\u201d\\n\\nCampers learned some of the history of data science, such as how physician John Snow first studied patterns in data to map the spread of cholera in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and identified the source of the outbreak. Today\u2019s scientific experimental facilities generate datasets that are vastly larger, and the camp covered contemporary search and analysis techniques such as data visualization methods.\\n\\n### A toolkit for accessing, exploring, and sharing data\\n\\nFor one task, students accessed and explored massive datasets generated by the University of Chicago\u2019s Array of Things (AoT) project, which employs a vast network of computer-embedded \u2018intelligent\u2019 sensors located throughout Chicago to monitor various activities, such as traffic hotspots, and environmental conditions, such as air quality. The AoT project, and its follow-on Software-Defined Sensor Network (SAGE) project, also funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), will deploy sensor nodes that support machine learning frameworks in three environmental testbeds and one additional urban testbed in the U.S., and in four other countries, to provide even more data\u2014all of which will be open and hosted in the cloud.\\n\\nTo bring order to the massive, amorphous datasets generated by the AoT project, the campers used the open-source web application Jupyter to create documents that contain live code, equations, narrative text, and visualizations\u2014all the essential tools that allowed the campers to analyze the data, but also to share what they learned and communicate it.\\n\\nLater in the week, the campers worked together in small groups to first design a problem and then apply their newly learned programming knowledge and analysis techniques.\\n\\n\u201cCreating their own project allowed them to see the potential challenges in solving big data problems,\u201d said Janet Knowles, a member of ALCF\u2019s visualization team who mentored one of the groups. \u201cI was there to provide guidance, but the kids had to come up with an interesting project with a useful solution.\u201d\\n\\n### Pivoting for the pandemic\\n\\nBy late March, shortly after schools were required to move instruction online because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organizing team that included Papka, visualization specialists Joe Insley and Silvio Rizzo, operations specialist Ti Leggett, and Argonne Learning Center Lead John Domyancich, needed a strategy to adapt the camp\u2019s hands-on, largely group-oriented lesson plan to a fully-remote experience. They saw several challenges, starting with how to provide students with resources capable of supporting the large data processing needs of the camp, and considered possible workarounds\u2014but never once did they consider cancelling the course.\\n\\nThe team assembled a toolkit that everyone could use to access datasets and to collaborate in live active sessions. Firstly, the campers needed significant data storage and processing power\u2014nearly all of these datasets involved were large: too large to e-mail, and certainly too large for campers to store or process locally. Second, the campers would be working on a variety of devices, from tablets to desktop computers. Lastly, the campers would need a persistent resource for the entire week. The team worked with the developers of Chameleon, a cloud infrastructure service that typically supports the NSF research community, to stand-up a virtual server that could be configured to meet all of the needs of the camp. \u201cChameleon gave us a powerful computing backend, which the students could access and fully utilize from any device,\u201d said Papka.\\n\\nParticipants of the 2020 Big Data Camp seemed to take all the changes in stride. \u201cI learned a lot about data visualization that I hope to apply to projects in the future,\u201d said one camper at the conclusion of the course. \u201cThanks for making Big Data Camp possible and for turning it into such a wonderful online learning experience,\u201d said another.\\n\\n\u201cThe feedback we received from the campers is part of a conversation we\u2019re having now about ways to adapt the camp\u2019s curriculum and develop learning environments to make it accessible to a larger group of students,\u201d said Domyancich.\\n\\nBig Data Camp volunteer instructors and mentors for 2020 included ALCF staff members Michael E. Papka, Joe Insley, Silvio Rizzi, Janet Knowles, Ti Leggett, and Katherine Riley; Argonne Mathematics and Computer Science Director Valerie Taylor; Argonne nuclear engineering postdoctoral student Aaron Oaks; Northern Illinois University Assistant Professor David Koop; former Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences Robin Graham; and Argonne Educational Programs and Outreach staff members Kelly Sturner and John Domyancich.\\n\\nThe ALCF is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility.\\n\\n### About Argonne\\n\\nArgonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology.
