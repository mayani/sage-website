Before joining NIU, I worked for 2 years in a Florida based startup as a research and development manager. There, my role was to design and build computer vision and machine learning based yard management system that automatically tracks the vehicles inside a freight yard. <!-- --> At NIU, I am deeply interested in solving complex real-life problems by employing computer science tools and techniques, especially artificial intelligence and computer vision. While working at Argonne National Lab in summer 2020, I worked on to design and build an AI-enabled computer vision system that counts the pedestrians who violate the crosswalk while crossing the street. The goal of this project is 3-fold; first – detect every pedestrian in the image, second – re-identify the pedestrian in successive frames to avoid their recounting, third – count the pedestrians who do not follow the crosswalk. A sample output image from the project is shown in Figure 1.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sample output image" src="/assets/images/Figure-1-9f27127491f03a7d01c424b60e84d233.png" width="468" height="352" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 1: A sample output image of pedestrian count project. Green box represents that the pedestrian has taken the crosswalk while crossing the street. White box represents that the pedestrian has not crossed the street yet.
Motivation</p></blockquote><p>An accurate and clear information about pedestrian travel patterns is a critical component of transportation planning, management and safety. Sound data on pedestrian system usage is needed for traffic safety, operations, maintenance as well as system user outreach and education.  According to CDC report <sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>, in 2017 alone, 5977 pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes in the United States. That’s about one death every 88 minutes. The broad motivation of this study is to explore the pedestrian travel patterns to understand the contexts in which they violate the traffic rules. To do so, the immediate goal is to count the number of pedestrians who do not follow the crosswalk while crossing the street.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-description">Data Description<a href="#data-description" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Description" title="Direct link to Data Description">​</a></h2><p>In this study, a total of 2,580,468 images were collected by employing a vision camera embedded in an AoT (Array of Things) <sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup> node (shown in Fig. 2). The AoT node is installed on a streetlight pole at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL in front of the Computer Science building. The camera captures the image (as shown in Figure 2) at 1 Hz frequency with the resolution of 96 dpi.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="aot install" src="/assets/images/Figure-2-5ca1308b247cc81b82156b5c2741558a.jpg" width="708" height="531" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 2: AoT node installed on a light pole at NIU campus
Approach</p></blockquote><p>In this section, I present a brief overview of the pedestrians counting process for crosswalk violation. The complete process is divided into 3 sequential sections as shown in Figure 3. First – detect every pedestrian in the image, second – re-identify same pedestrian in successive images to avoid their recounting and third – detect when the pedestrian finished crossing the street. Each part is explained in the following sections.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="workflow diagram " src="/assets/images/Figure-3-e5e5aa279678d31c0dbb389d62b68644.png" width="1040" height="237" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 3: Workflow diagram for pedestrian crosswalk violation
Pedestrian Detection</p></blockquote><p>The first step is to detect every pedestrian along with their position in the image. To do so, one approach could be to train a neural network-based pedestrian detection model that identifies and locates the pedestrian in the image. However, this process would require a lot of manual image tagging without getting any new results since several popular pre-trained models are already available that can do a fine job in person detection. These pre-trained models are trained on a popular COCO dataset <sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup> which includes more than hundred thousand images. Model accuracy is an important factor here because if it misses any pedestrian in the image then the final pedestrian counting cannot be accurate. To take it into consideration, I selected the Faster R-CNN <sup><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup> based NasNet <sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup> object detection model from the TensorFlow model zoo <sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup>. Although NasNet model has high latency, it has very good mean average precision value to detect the objects precisely in the image. The images are input to NasNet model and store the prediction results in the XML format. A sample of image and generated XML is shown in Figure 4. XML stores each detected objects’ name and their box coordinates.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="output image and xml from NasNet" src="/assets/images/Figure-4-68dd22408d808e130e55c350da0254c2.png" width="1426" height="788" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 4: Output image and XML generated from NasNet object detection model. Detected objects are boxed in the image.
Pedestrian Re-identification (ReID)</p></blockquote><p>Once each pedestrian’s position is stored in the XML, the next part is to identify them in successive images to avoid their recounting. In computer vision community, this task is called pedestrian re-identification (ReID) <!-- -->[7]<!-- -->. The idea behind ReID is to find a metrics or representation of a pedestrian in the image that is invariant of different angles, distance, zoom level, etc. Neural networks-based models try to learn local regions (shoes, glasses, hair color, etc.) as well as global full body region (t-shirt and shorts color, design, etc.) features to discriminate the one pedestrian from others. At the end of training, these models aim to generate invariant multi-dimensional features of a pedestrian from different angles, distance, clothes, etc. In this study, I have leveraged a deep learning-based model deep-person-reid <!-- -->[7,8]<!-- --> to generate such features of each pedestrian detected in the frame to compare with the pedestrians from the following frames for re-identification. The model generates 1024-dimensional features for each pedestrian cropped in a rectangular box. The cosine similarity is calculated for feature vectors of one frame against successive frames. Pedestrians are considered same if they have high cosine score, hence, assigned the same pedestrian id. In other cases where cosine similarity is below a pre-defined threshold, both pedestrians are assigned different ids. Low matching score may also happen where pedestrian is partially occluded by a car or another pedestrian in next frame, the similarity score gets very low. To mitigate this issue, the algorithm compared the current frame against last 5 consecutive frames to avoid assigning new id to same pedestrian. Another challenge I faced with the threshold-based matching is when one pedestrian had high similarity scores against multiple pedestrians. To fix this issue, I employed the greedy method in which it ranks each pair according to their similarity score. Based on their ranking, the algorithm picks the top pair and assigns same id to both pedestrians, and subsequently removes other pairs where any one of the pedestrians from the top pair is present. By employing these techniques, I was able to assign unique id to distinct pedestrian.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pedestrian-count-for-crosswalk-violation">Pedestrian Count for Crosswalk Violation<a href="#pedestrian-count-for-crosswalk-violation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pedestrian Count for Crosswalk Violation" title="Direct link to Pedestrian Count for Crosswalk Violation">​</a></h2><p>Now that a unique id is assigned to each distinct pedestrian (barring any errors), the next and the final step in the pipeline is to count the number of pedestrians who have violated the crosswalk while crossing the street. The output of this step will be two metrics for any given time period – 1) number of pedestrians crossed the street and 2) number of pedestrians followed the crosswalk while crossing the street. Subtracting the 2nd metric from 1st one will give the count of crosswalk violations. To compute these metrices, it is important to locate the street and crosswalk in the image. Fortunately, in this case, camera is installed on a fixed streetlight pole which didn’t shake or vibrate significantly due to wind or heavy vehicles. Taking advantage of it, I pre-set the location of crosswalk and street in the image (as shown in Figure 1, the crosswalk is highlighted in yellow and both sides of street in red). While the pre-set of crosswalk is represented in a form of convex polygon, both sides of the street are depicted by two parallel straight lines. These representations helped to determine the location of any pedestrian with respect to the crosswalk and the street. To recall, pedestrian’s location in the image is stored as co-ordinates of 4 corners of a rectangular box. In a 2D image, it is essential to measure each pedestrian’s location by a single (x,y) co-ordinate to make a concrete decision about their position with reference to crosswalk and street. If we observe the Figure 5, the lady is walking on the pavement towards the computer science building, but her head and center of body are still in the street (due to 2D image display) while legs are on the pavement. Similar observations in multiple images made me select the legs position to represent the pedestrian’s location because when pedestrian moves, legs represent the current location in the 2D image.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="an detection of crossing" src="/assets/images/Figure-5-d13a94b38c235858951c5671ec67d3db.jpg" width="1430" height="996" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 5 : Our algorithm detects that a person has crossed the street.</p></blockquote><p>Now that a pedestrian’s position has been established, I will briefly discuss about the simple rules to determine if a pedestrian has crossed the street and followed/ violated the crosswalk.  A pedestrian is considered to have crossed the street if they are detected on both sides of the street within a fixed time. To recall, the street has been represented by two straight lines, one for each side (as shown in red in Figure 1). The sign of these straight lines against the pedestrian’s coordinates exhibits their position relative to the street. For example, as we see in Figure 6, points A and B are in opposite sides of the straight line which can be verified by putting the value of these points coordinates in the line equation. While the value for point A is -2, for point B it is +3. Opposite signs of both points resemble that they are in opposite sides of the straight line. By similar means, we can compute if the pedestrian has been present to both sides of the street which will confirm that the pedestrian has crossed it. Additionally, to determine if the pedestrian has used the crosswalk, we can similarly verify their positions in the middle of the street. If all of their detected positions are inside the crosswalk polygon, I consider that the pedestrian has used the crosswalk. Using these 2 metrics, the count for crosswalk violations can be easily computed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="determining position" src="/assets/images/Figure-6-b846e0c705b7777ba6b2decf07f353c2.png" width="252" height="185" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 6: Determining the position of the points with respect to the straight line
Future Works</p></blockquote><p>In the current study, the implemented system is able to count the pedestrians who violates the crosswalk. Currently, data processing and AI algorithms execute on a server located in computer science building where AoT node periodically stores the images. Many images are lost due to wireless nature of communication. One potential solution can be to implement the algorithms on the AoT node and only transmit the results (instead of images) to server to reduce the overhead on wireless connection significantly. Further, I would like to generalize the system for other sites as well. For that, algorithms have to identify the street and crosswalk automatically in the image.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h3><ol><li>A CDC Report on pedestrian Safety.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For five days last July, fourteen high school students attended a virtual coding camp sponsored by Argonne National Laboratory’s Educational Programs and Outreach and the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), co-taught by laboratory scientists and informal learning educators, and focused on learning techniques for probing and analyzing massive scientific datasets.</p><p>And while the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed how these students met, worked, and collaborated over the course of the week, they, and their instructors, found new and creative methods to explore the fascinating world of data science.</p><p>Argonne’s Big Data Camp is the most recent addition to a growing number of STEM camps for middle school and high school students, offered by the laboratory’s education and outreach department, and aimed at teaching computer science skills and computational thinking. The curriculums are developed and taught by Argonne Educational Programs staff and Argonne scientists. The Big Data Camp curriculum targets juniors and seniors who have programming experience.</p><p>“We teach students how researchers produce and process data to better understand a whole range of complex problems from the urgent, like those posed by the current pandemic, to the theoretical, such as the nature of dark matter,” said Michael E. Papka, Argonne senior scientist and camp instructor, who also helped establish the Big Data Camp three years ago. “We build on their existing programming knowledge and introduced them to some of the same techniques researchers use at the lab to interrogate data and gain new insights.”</p><p>Campers learned some of the history of data science, such as how physician John Snow first studied patterns in data to map the spread of cholera in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and identified the source of the outbreak. Today’s scientific experimental facilities generate datasets that are vastly larger, and the camp covered contemporary search and analysis techniques such as data visualization methods.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-toolkit-for-accessing-exploring-and-sharing-data">A toolkit for accessing, exploring, and sharing data<a href="#a-toolkit-for-accessing-exploring-and-sharing-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A toolkit for accessing, exploring, and sharing data" title="Direct link to A toolkit for accessing, exploring, and sharing data">​</a></h3><p>For one task, students accessed and explored massive datasets generated by the University of Chicago’s Array of Things (AoT) project, which employs a vast network of computer-embedded ‘intelligent’ sensors located throughout Chicago to monitor various activities, such as traffic hotspots, and environmental conditions, such as air quality. The AoT project, and its follow-on Software-Defined Sensor Network (SAGE) project, also funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), will deploy sensor nodes that support machine learning frameworks in three environmental testbeds and one additional urban testbed in the U.S., and in four other countries, to provide even more data—all of which will be open and hosted in the cloud.</p><p>To bring order to the massive, amorphous datasets generated by the AoT project, the campers used the open-source web application Jupyter to create documents that contain live code, equations, narrative text, and visualizations—all the essential tools that allowed the campers to analyze the data, but also to share what they learned and communicate it.</p><p>Later in the week, the campers worked together in small groups to first design a problem and then apply their newly learned programming knowledge and analysis techniques.</p><p>“Creating their own project allowed them to see the potential challenges in solving big data problems,” said Janet Knowles, a member of ALCF’s visualization team who mentored one of the groups. “I was there to provide guidance, but the kids had to come up with an interesting project with a useful solution.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pivoting-for-the-pandemic">Pivoting for the pandemic<a href="#pivoting-for-the-pandemic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pivoting for the pandemic" title="Direct link to Pivoting for the pandemic">​</a></h3><p>By late March, shortly after schools were required to move instruction online because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organizing team that included Papka, visualization specialists Joe Insley and Silvio Rizzo, operations specialist Ti Leggett, and Argonne Learning Center Lead John Domyancich, needed a strategy to adapt the camp’s hands-on, largely group-oriented lesson plan to a fully-remote experience. They saw several challenges, starting with how to provide students with resources capable of supporting the large data processing needs of the camp, and considered possible workarounds—but never once did they consider cancelling the course.</p><p>The team assembled a toolkit that everyone could use to access datasets and to collaborate in live active sessions. Firstly, the campers needed significant data storage and processing power—nearly all of these datasets involved were large: too large to e-mail, and certainly too large for campers to store or process locally. Second, the campers would be working on a variety of devices, from tablets to desktop computers. Lastly, the campers would need a persistent resource for the entire week. The team worked with the developers of Chameleon, a cloud infrastructure service that typically supports the NSF research community, to stand-up a virtual server that could be configured to meet all of the needs of the camp. “Chameleon gave us a powerful computing backend, which the students could access and fully utilize from any device,” said Papka.</p><p>Participants of the 2020 Big Data Camp seemed to take all the changes in stride. “I learned a lot about data visualization that I hope to apply to projects in the future,” said one camper at the conclusion of the course. “Thanks for making Big Data Camp possible and for turning it into such a wonderful online learning experience,” said another.</p><p>“The feedback we received from the campers is part of a conversation we’re having now about ways to adapt the camp’s curriculum and develop learning environments to make it accessible to a larger group of students,” said Domyancich.</p><p>Big Data Camp volunteer instructors and mentors for 2020 included ALCF staff members Michael E. Papka, Joe Insley, Silvio Rizzi, Janet Knowles, Ti Leggett, and Katherine Riley; Argonne Mathematics and Computer Science Director Valerie Taylor; Argonne nuclear engineering postdoctoral student Aaron Oaks; Northern Illinois University Assistant Professor David Koop; former Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences Robin Graham; and Argonne Educational Programs and Outreach staff members Kelly Sturner and John Domyancich.</p><p>The ALCF is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-argonne">About Argonne<a href="#about-argonne" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About Argonne" title="Direct link to About Argonne">​</a></h3><p>Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology.
